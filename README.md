Algorithms
==========

This repository contains implementation of some common algorithms for learning purpose. Most of the algorithms implemented here are discussed or asked in CLRS (Introduction to Algorithm Book). Few solutions are implementation of problems appeared in programming contest such as codejam, spoj, and topcoder.

**Implementations are not optomized, therefore, it is recommended to use them for only reference or learning purposes. However you can use them on your own risks for other purposes**

"Enjoy :)!!!"
